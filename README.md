<h1>MOST-extruder-drive</h1>

Filament extruder drive derived from Airtripper's Bowden Extruder V3 (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:35404)

Modifications include:
<ul>
<li>Parametrization of many dimensions</li>
<li>Ability to feed 3mm filament</li>
<li>Align filament path with Mk7 drive gear</li>
<li>Add filament infeed tube mount to facilitate live feeding of new filament</li>
<li>Replaced M3 x 6mm button head screw with M3 x 6mm socket head screw</li>
<li>Minimize gap bewteen preload idler bearing and its pocket</li>
</ul>

The ability to live-feeding new filament is much improved in this design. An example of its performance may be seen at: http://youtu.be/CeC4qyN01uE
